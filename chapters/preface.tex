\section*{Preface}
This thesis aims to show how genetic algorithms can contribute in solving the problem of positioning wind turbines in a wind farm in an optimal way. Specifically, population distributed genetic algorithms will be implemented and tested in order to find out if their properties can contribute to find an even better solution than simple genetic algorithms.
